- Just Zoom is now also available for Fabric and NeoForge (was only Forge before)
- Zooming now correctly works when in third-person (not mirrored third-person)
- It will not zoom anymore while in mirrored third-person
- Smooth zoom in/out now works better (uses Vanilla's smooth FOV changing now)
- The mod now normalizes the mouse sensitivity when zooming (can be turned off)
- You can turn off the cinematic/smooth camera movement when zooming now
