CHANGELOG | JUST ZOOM v2.0.0

This is a full rewrite of Just Zoom! There can be bugs, but in general everything should work much better now!

- Just Zoom is now also available for Fabric and NeoForge (was only Forge before)
- Zooming now correctly works when in third-person (not mirrored third-person)
- It will not zoom anymore while in mirrored third-person
- Smooth zoom in/out now works better (uses Vanilla's smooth FOV changing now)
- The mod now normalizes the mouse sensitivity when zooming (can be turned off)
- You can turn off the cinematic/smooth camera movement when zooming now
- There's an in-game options screen for Just Zoom now (access it by pressing the spyglass button at the bottom-left side of the Pause screen)
